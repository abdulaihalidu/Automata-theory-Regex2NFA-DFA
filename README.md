# Automata-theory-Regex2NFA-DFA

This program was implemented as part of my semester project in my automata theory course.
This project converts any given regular expression to an NFA and in turn, can also convert any given NFA to its equivalent DFA. 
Feel free to raise an issue in case you find any bug. Any suggesion to improve the code is also welcomed.
